## Immutable artefact

In scope of BMA-54425 our environment profile functionality was changed by moving them out of build process.
Now all environment data is taken from oxygenEnvConfig which is saved in global window object.
In scope of SDO-7015 pipelines were changes so all build are stored on S3 and all possible profiles for each brand/platform are generated by `generateBrandProfiles` webpack script.
When you want to change profile you have to select profile and branch name plus pipeline number(e.g. BMA-54426/63). It will take you ~1 minute

## Switch profile on-fly(local only)

Run `switchProfile` script to switch your current profile to another one(if exist).

Possible flags:
env.brand with possible options: coral, ladbrokes.  (coral by default)
env.platform with possible options: Mobile, Desktop.  (Mobile by default). Note: platform should start from capital letter.
env.profile - options could be found below in "Available Environments" chapter.  (dev0 by default)

Example: npm run switchProfile --env.brand=ladbrokes --env.environment=tst0 --env.platform=Desktop
