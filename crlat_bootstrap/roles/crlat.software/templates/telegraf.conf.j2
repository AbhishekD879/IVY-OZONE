## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of
## tags.
## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
## available properties for a device by running:
## 'udevadm info -q property -n /dev/sda'
# device_tags = ["ID_FS_TYPE", "ID_FS_USAGE"]
#
## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
## name of the device via templates.
## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
## the near-meaningless DM-0 name.
# name_templates = ["$ID_FS_LABEL","$DM_VG_NAME/$DM_LV_NAME"]
