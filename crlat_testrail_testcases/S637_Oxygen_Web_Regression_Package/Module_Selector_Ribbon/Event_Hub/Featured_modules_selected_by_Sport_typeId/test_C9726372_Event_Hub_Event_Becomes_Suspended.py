    TR_ID: C9726372
    NAME: Event Hub: Event Becomes Suspended
    DESCRIPTION: This test case verifies situation when event/events become suspended on event landing page on the 'Event Hub' tab(mobile/tablet)
    PRECONDITIONS: 1. Event Hub is created in CMS. Modules are created and contain events/selections
    PRECONDITIONS: 2. Oxygen application is loaded on Mobile/Tablet
    PRECONDITIONS: 3. user is on Event Hub tab on Homepage
    PRECONDITIONS: **NOTE:**
    PRECONDITIONS: 1. For creating modules use CMS (https://confluence.egalacoral.com/display/SPI/Environments+-+to+be+reviewed) ->Sport pages > Event Hub -> Add Sport Module
    PRECONDITIONS: 2. To get into SiteServer use this link:
    PRECONDITIONS: http://backoffice-tst2.coral.co.uk/openbet-ssviewer/Drilldown/Z.ZZ/EventToOutcomeForEvent/XXXX?translationLang=LL
    PRECONDITIONS: where:
    PRECONDITIONS: *   Z.ZZ Â - current supported version of OpenBet SiteServer
    PRECONDITIONS: *   XXXX - event ID
    PRECONDITIONS: *   LL - language (e.g. en, ukr)
    PRECONDITIONS: 3. After suspending <Race> events they disappear from the FE which is by design.
