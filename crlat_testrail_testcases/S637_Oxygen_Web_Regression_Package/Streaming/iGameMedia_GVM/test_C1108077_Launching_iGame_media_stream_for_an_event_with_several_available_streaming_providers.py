    PRECONDITIONS: 2. IGame Media stream is mapped for an event (or any stream through IGame media)

    PRECONDITIONS: 4. User is logged in and placed a minimum sum of Â£1 on one or many Selections within tested event
    PRECONDITIONS: 5. The following parameters should be received in Optin MS response in order play iGameMedia stream on mentioned devices/platforms:
    PRECONDITIONS: mobile: ['HLS-LOW'],
    PRECONDITIONS: wrapper: ['HLS-LOW-RAW'] (video URL link is available and native player works as expected, in another case - error that stream is not available is displayed),
