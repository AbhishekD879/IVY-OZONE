    TR_ID: C141218
    NAME: Handling of API errors for  iGameMedia Stream
    DESCRIPTION: This test case verifies behavior of the application when API returns an error during the opt-in call for stream data reception
    DESCRIPTION: Applies to <Race>/<Sport> events
    PRECONDITIONS: 1. SiteServer event should be configured to support GVM streaming ( **'drilldownTagNames'** ='EVFLAG_GVM' and **'typeFlagCodes'='GVA'** flags should be set) and should be mapped to GVM stream event
    PRECONDITIONS: 2. User is logged in and placed a minimum sum of Â£1 on one or many Selections within tested events(Sport/Race)
    PRECONDITIONS: 3. Event should have the following attributes:
    PRECONDITIONS: *   isMarketBetInRun = "true"
    PRECONDITIONS: for <Race> events:
    PRECONDITIONS: *   isStarted = "true", but stream has not run for more than 1 minute after the 'start time'
    PRECONDITIONS: for <Sport> events:
    PRECONDITIONS: *   isStarted = "true"
    PRECONDITIONS: 4. API should return an error(case of a broken/missing token)
    PRECONDITIONS: In order to reproduce this behavior, use a '/auth/invalidateSession' DELETE command in POSTMAN (you will need BPP Request URL, username and BPP token - first 1 can be found in XHR response by 'bp' input in the search field); last 2 can be found in Application - Local Storage of the Web Browser
    PRECONDITIONS: ![](index.php?/attachments/get/18576789) / ![](index.php?/attachments/get/18576792)
    PRECONDITIONS: **--> NOTE!**
    PRECONDITIONS: If you kill user token before event/stream start time and click/tap 'Watch Live'/'Watch' afterwards, you receive following error "This stream has not yet started. Please try again soon."
    PRECONDITIONS: **This is an expected behavior and for now left as it is.**
