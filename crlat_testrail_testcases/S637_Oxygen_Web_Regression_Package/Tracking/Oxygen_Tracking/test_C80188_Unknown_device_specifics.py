    TR_ID: C80188
    NAME: 'Unknown device' specifics
    DESCRIPTION: After successful registration or sign in user information are written to the IMS system
    DESCRIPTION: This test case verifies 2 fields in the IMS:
    DESCRIPTION: - deviceType
    DESCRIPTION: - clientPlatform
    DESCRIPTION: Any tablet devices determined to be a valid tablet type will be classified as a valid device type and a clientPlatform value of "mobile";
    DESCRIPTION: Any mobile devices determined to be a valid mobile type will be classified as a valid device type and a clientPlatform value of "mobile"; therefore using the non-3DS payment route
    DESCRIPTION: Any device classified as "Unknown Device" will have a default clientPlatform value of "mobile"; therefore using the non-3DS payment route.
