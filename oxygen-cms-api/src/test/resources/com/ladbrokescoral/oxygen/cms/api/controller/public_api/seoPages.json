Can Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Chris Coleman's less lauded players cause an upset to humble Roy Hodgson and a young Three Lions team? World Cup winners Germany playing Poland should also be absorbing, with Bayern Munich star striker Robert Lewandowski set to turn out against many of his club teammates in Group C. Northern Ireland, plucky qualifiers for a major tournament for the first time in 30 years here, must face both of those and Ukraine. The Republic of Ireland, meanwhile, have the daunting task of meeting Belgium, Italy and Sweden in Group E. Martin O'Neill may have masterminded a road to the France finals, but his squad make a huge step up against star players like Eden Hazard, Andrea Pirlo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic here. Tournament hosts Les Bleus look to have a straightforward pool with Group A opposition provided by Switzerland, Romania and Albania.
