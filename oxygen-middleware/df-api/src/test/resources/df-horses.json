The vote goes to CROWNTHORPE, who appeared to win with a bit in hand over C\u0026D last time and may again have the race run to suit. As such, he can follow up and confirm the form with runner-up Bedouin\u0027s Story. Baltic Baron is another to consider on his AW debut and third start for David O\u0027Meara. This colt may be the main danger to the selection. [David Bellingham]",
